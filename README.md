<h1>Mine Sweeper Game</h1>

<h2>For the project we have to develop a MineSweeper Game, in the Java programming language by a team of three people (Sam Gonzalez, Ignacio Salceda and Sabrina Lanza)</h2>

<p>First the user must choose a level of difficulty (easy, medium or hard). Once the level has been chosen, it will be passed to the part where the cells and bombs are located, where depending on the level of difficulty selected, the number of bombs and cells will also depend. </p>

<br>

<p>In the case of the easy level, there are 64 cells and 8 bombs, for the average level there are 162 cells and 24 bombs, and the hard level consists of 262 cells and 68 bombs. </p>

<br>

<p>For the first week the following tasks should be performed (the creation of six classes): </p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li> Difficulty </li>
  <li> Board </li>
  <li> BombCell </li>
  <li> Cell </li>
  <li> EmptyCell </li>
  <li> Game </li>
</ul>
